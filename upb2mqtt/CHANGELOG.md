# Changelog

## 0.1.2

- Fix: scenes failed to activate from Home Assistant (`KeyError: 'payload_on'`);
  discovery now sends `payload_on` explicitly.
- Add a *Refresh state* button (diagnostic) to every UPB device, the MQTT
  replacement for `homeassistant.update_entity` on the old integration's lights.

## 0.1.1

- Fix: run without s6-overlay so the app sees SUPERVISOR_TOKEN and can
  get the Mosquitto broker credentials from the Supervisor.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: upb-lib 0.7.2 bridged to MQTT with Home Assistant discovery.
